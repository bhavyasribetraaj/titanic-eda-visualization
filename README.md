# Titanic EDA Visualization

This project is a part of the AI & ML Internship Task 2: **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The goal is to understand the Titanic dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

---

## 📌 Task Objectives

- Generate summary statistics.
- Create visualizations (histograms, boxplots, pairplots, heatmaps).
- Understand data patterns, skewness, and potential multicollinearity.
- Make feature-level inferences visually.

## 📁 Dataset

I used the classic [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset), which contains information about passengers and their survival status from the Titanic shipwreck.
